Automation Project tasks
Task 1

Automation Project is a Maven project named SauceDemo. The task was to use TestNg annotations, and ChromDrive. In the .pom file, I have included the dependencies needed.
Using a Page Object Model, I have saved the classes, the methods, and the WebElement in SauceDemo\src\test\java\PagesSauceDemo
The tests are located in SauceDemo\src\test\java\TestSauceDemo
I have managed to successfully respond to the most of the requests in the Automation Project.
